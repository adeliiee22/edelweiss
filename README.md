# C-C++ Chemistry Calculator
# To begin, before running the code, the code makes extensive use of structs to assign data to different elements of the periodic table, as well as conditional statements in many of its constituent parts.
# When the code is executed, it returns a list of the program's nine available options. It then asks the user to enter a number in order to select one of the options. When a user selects an option, a new set of instructions appears, asking the user to enter known values/data that can be used to find an answer using the inputted data. n some cases, the user may need to select an even more specific option in the calculator before inputting values as there is such a wide variety of options within the program.
# Once the user has entered all of the required information, the program will output a calculated answer and exit. If the user changes the option in the calculator, they will have to run the program again and select the desired option.
